#### THIRD PARTY RESOURCES:

ATTRIBUTIONS
<br>
For this project, I used two pre-existing colab Notebooks, StyleGAN2 ADA attributed to Derrick Schultz and NVIDIA, and CycleGAN-pix2pix adaptation attributed to Jun-Yan Zhu and Taesung Park. I included a copy of each notebook's license in this Github repo, as well as an attribution section at the top of each colab notebook. Furthermore, I have also used other third party code which I reference when used in the colab code block itself.

WHAT I CHANGED
<br>
I tweaked and modified the existing colab notebooks to suit the nature of my project. As someone who doesn't have an extensive knowledge of python, I did resort to google and forums for most of the changes I wanted to apply. Therefore, there is a lot of third party code which I have taken the length to understand in order to modify accordingly and make sure users don't run into errors while using these notebooks.
