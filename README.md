#### THIRD PARTY RESOURCES:

For this project, I used two pre-existing colab Notebooks, StyleGAN2 ADA attributed to Derrick Schultz and NVIDIA, and CycleGAN-pix2pix adaptation attributed to Jun-Yan Zhu and Taesung Park. I included a copy of each notebook's license is available in this Github repo, as well as an attribution section at the top of each notebook.
